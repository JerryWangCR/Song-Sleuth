## How It Works 

***Currently still in development ~ 70% completed
**<br/>
<br/>
After user logins into Spotify, they are then brought to a home screen that displays various playlists. Currently, they are all jazz playlists created by Spotify, however, we will implement a screen that allows the user to specified what playlist genre or playlist they want to be quized on in the future. Once they've selected a playlist, they are then brought to the game screen that will test them on a song from the playlist that is being played (using the spotify preview song). Currently, we have not fully implemented the game flow, however, in the future, we will update the game flow to be more intuitive and cohorent. However, right now four random songs are pulled from that playlist and displayed on the buttons, with one of those songs being the answer to the question.
 
## Future Updates

1) Add playlist genre selection screen.
2) Update game flow.
3) Allow users to select their own playlists.
4) Add score tracking.
5) Add different gamemodes.
6) Clean up user interface and app design.
7) After app is finished, we plan to upload it to the App Store and Google Play Store!
